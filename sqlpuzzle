1: distance_per_dollar question Uber
https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/10302-distance-per-dollar?code_type=1
You’re given a dataset of uber rides with the traveling distance (‘distance_to_travel’) and cost (‘monetary_cost’) for each ride. First, find the difference between the distance-per-dollar for each date and the average distance-per-dollar for that year-month. Distance-per-dollar is defined as the distance traveled divided by the cost of the ride. Use the calculated difference on each date to calculate absolute average difference in distance-per-dollar metric on monthly basis (year-month).


The output should include the year-month (YYYY-MM) and the absolute average difference in distance-per-dollar (Absolute value to be rounded to the 2nd decimal).
You should also count both success and failed request_status as the distance and cost values are populated for all ride requests. Also, assume that all dates are unique in the dataset. Order your results by earliest request date first.

The demo sample query is wrong as he only calculated the avg function on the dist_per_cost in his first x min video, but he corrected the alias and calculation in final video.

Use window function can reduce sub-query usage, but still can work this out without using window function

ABC Corp is a mid-sized insurer in the US and in the recent past their fraudulent claims have increased significantly for their personal auto insurance portfolio. They have developed a ML based predictive model to identify propensity of fraudulent claims. Now, they assign highly experienced claim adjusters for top 5 percentile of claims identified by the model.
Your objective is to identify the top 5 percentile of claims from each state. Your output should be policy number, state, claim cost, and fraud score.

4:growth of Airbnb
https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/9637-growth-of-airbnb?code_type=1

Estimate the growth of Airbnb each year using the number of hosts registered as the growth metric. The rate of growth is calculated by taking ((number of hosts registered in the current year - number of hosts registered in the previous year) / the number of hosts registered in the previous year) * 100.
Output the year, number of hosts in the current year, number of hosts in the previous year, and the rate of growth. Round the rate of growth to the nearest percent and order the result in the ascending order based on the year.
Assume that the dataset consists only of unique hosts, meaning there are no duplicate hosts listed.

Revenue Over Time Amazon
https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/2148-monthly-sales-rolling-average?code_type=1

Find the 3-month rolling average of total revenue from purchases given a table with users, their purchase amount, and date purchased. Do not include returns which are represented by negative purchase values. Output the year-month (YYYY-MM) and 3-month rolling average of revenue, sorted from earliest month to latest month.
A 3-month rolling average is defined by calculating the average total revenue from all user purchases for the current month and previous two months. The first two months will not be a true 3-month rolling average since we are not given data from last year. Assume each month has at least one purchase.

Monthly Sales Rolling Average Amazon
https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/2148-monthly-sales-rolling-average?code_type=1
You have been asked to calculate the rolling average for book sales in 2022.


A rolling average continuously updates a data set's average to include all data in the set up to that point. For example, the rolling average for February would be calculated by adding the book sales from January and February and dividing by two; the rolling average for March would be calculated by adding the book sales from January, February, and March and dividing by three; and so on.


Output the month, the sales for that month, and an extra column containing the rolling average rounded to the nearest whole number.

to_char(bo.order_date,'YYYY-MM') as year_month

along with the corresponding number of churns in that year, the number of churns in the previous year, and an indication on whether the number has been increased (output the value 'increase'), 
decreased (output the value 'decrease') or stayed the same (output the value 'no change').

Calculate each user's average session time. A session is defined as the time difference between a page_load and page_exit. For simplicity, assume a user has only 1 session per day and
if there are multiple of the same events on that day, consider only the latest page_load and earliest page_exit, with an obvious restriction that load time event should happen before exit time event . Output the user_id and their average session time.

instructions: https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/doordash-sql-interview-questions/
Imagine you’re a data analyst at DoorDash, and Management wants to know, for every month, what percentage of their orders are ‘extremely late deliveries’. A delivery is considered ‘extremely late’ if the order is delivered more than 20 minutes late of the predicted delivery time.

Intuitively, we would monitor the number of ‘extremely late’ deliveries month on month. However, we cannot look at this number alone. The total deliveries will change monthly and fluctuate based on season, holidays, and due to the general growth of the company. A better metric to track is the percentage of total orders that are ‘extremely late’. This is exactly what this DoorDash SQL interview question is asking us to do.

Ideally, we want to see this metric lower over time or at least, be kept within a certain threshold. Otherwise, this is a cause for concern, leading to low ratings, less repeat business, and poor food quality. Sooner than you think, the company is out of business. And you’re out of your job!

Using a framework for that will help you structure your thoughts and communicate them in a way that the interviewer can follow. This is important because oftentimes, it is not only your coding skills that are being tested but your communication skills as well.

The framework we recommend consists of the following steps.
Explore and understand the dataset
Confirm and state your assumptions
Outline your high-level approach in English or pseudo-code
Code the solution
Code optimizations (if there are any)

Once an order is placed, it is assigned a unique delivery ID, and the relevant details about the order like the customer, the restaurant, the date, and time of order are then logged. 
The delivery time/expected time of arrival of delivery is computed, and the order is assigned to a dasher/rider whose ID is also included in the table. 
Once the order is delivered, the exact time is logged, and the customer provides their feedback through a rating.

Lowest Revenue Generated Restaurants
Write a query that returns a list of the bottom 2% revenue generating restaurants. Return a list of restaurant IDs and their total revenue from when customers placed orders in May 2020.
You can calculate the total revenue by summing the order_total column. And you should calculate the bottom 2% by partitioning the total revenue into evenly distributed buckets.
